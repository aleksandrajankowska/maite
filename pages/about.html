                    <p data-aos="fade-left" style="margin-left: 2vw;">Maïté Cote-Pickard is a Canadian artist who works with a variety of media, but principally painting and drawing. Through this medium, her art creates dreamlike portraits of women that contemplates the mystical elements of femininity, portraying women as strong, powerful beings.<br><br>Maïté is a graduate of the prestigious Concordia University Fine Arts program.<br><br>She later studied Fashion Design at the Richard Robinson Academy of Fashion Design for two consecutive summers.<br><br>Maïté’s works use the strong eye contact of her subjects to establish a connection with the viewer into the emotional realm of the piece. Her works are inspired by the human / feminine condition, the parallel between dreams, the reality of universal truths and metaphysics. Observations from her reality; which she finds through travel, energy, nature, music and her dreams are which fuels her visions. From a young age, Maïté would draw mainly faces of women, from her imagination, dreams, observations and from inspiring images she would find in the world around her.<br><br>Knowing from a young age that art was what she was most passionate about, from watching her mother draw and paint from a young age, Maïté was always inspired and curious about creating art. What helped her a lot during her early years in school was mainly the fact that she had the experience of learning at an Alternative School called “Peace school” where learners were encouraged to explore their talents. This was a big opportunity for Maïté to draw and paint daily during school time. What inspired her most was creating portraits as she was drawn to and fascinated by capturing emotions in the eyes of a female person.<br><br>Maïté’s natural talent got her to exhibit for the youth program in Montreal’s prestigious Museum of Fine Arts.<br><br>From a young age, she would draw mainly faces of women, from her imagination, observations and images she would find. It is only later in high school that she discovered how to paint while taking after school painting lessons with Sarah Fecteau.<br><br>In recent years, Maïté has defined her own unique painting style which uses a series of colors and her own mastered techniques to create her works of art.</p>
